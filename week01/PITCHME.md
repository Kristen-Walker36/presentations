## What is (Cooperative) Interaction?


<img align="center" width="75%" height="75%" src="images/discourse-continuum.png">

<span class="footnote"><a style='text-decoration:none;' href='#/21'>Discourse Continuum (adapted from H. H. Clark, 1996)</a></span>

Note:

- We share knowledge in order to be understood
- We coordinate our interaction
- We do so cooperatively

## Attributes of Dialogue

<ul>
  <li><span style="color:#36e442">Clerk: </span>Can I help you?</li>
  <li><span style="color:#d73784">Customer: </span>How much is this?</li>
  <li><span style="color:#36e442">Clerk: </span>That's 3.99</li>
  <li><span style="color:#d73784">Customer: </span>I'll take it</li>
</ul>

Note:

- Structure, such as opening, closing
- Topic
- Turns
- Question answer pairs
- Expectation in terms of timing of response
- Expectation about who speaks next
- Expectation that the response is appropriate

And... it's a script. You know it. Even if they were speaking a different language entirely, you would recognize it and have expectations about what to expect.

## Dialogue?

## Speaker Contribution

<ul>
  <li>What do you want to communicate?</li>
  <li>What does the hearer know?</li>
  <li><span style="color:#e49436">How do you want the user to respond?</span></li>
</ul>

Note:

- As as designer, you are a participant in a conversation; when you plan a design, think of yourself as speaking to the user.

---

## As a designer, you plan for how you want the user to <span style="color:#e49436">respond</span>.

Note:

- By 'respond', think about both behavior, in terms of actions, attitude, intent -- and feelings.
- Design is intrinsically communication.

- In this course, we will explore basic cognitive processes that you can use as levers to align user perceptions and actions.

- We'll be unpacking hidden structure that will develop you as a designer.

## Human Computer Interaction

- **The study of interaction between people and technology**
- One goal of HCI, as a research discipline, is to achieve "naturalistic" interaction with computers. (e.g, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA1hD3XRlh0">Star Trek</a>)
- HCI has mature, well-defined methodologies and scientific practice

Note:

 - Theory is drawn from what we know about how minds work and how humans interact in social situations
- Another way of thinking of "naturalistic" is the idea of minimizing the distance between the user's mental model of a task and the computer's representation and support of that task.

Practitioners (interaction designers) are concerned with practical problems in the world.

Researchers are interested in new design methodologies, experimentation to identify fundamental principles, and developing models that capture concepts and relations.

- HCI is the research correlate of "interaction design"

## HCI is a Multi-Disciplinary Field

<img align="right" width="75%" height="75%" src="images/preece.png">


<span class="footnote"><a style='text-decoration:none;' href='#/21'>Preece</a></span>

Note:

The term HCI was popularized in the 80' by Stuart Card, Thomas Moran, and Allen Newell in "The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction".

---

## Research Methods

Primary methodologies include:

- Observational (e.g, ethnographic research)
- Survey
- Controlled experimentation

Note:

We will look at each, but focus on hypothesis testing.

- Measure alternative designs in a very precise way.
- Much foundational work has been conducted using experimental methods.
- And we need to understand scientific methods in order to read much of the foundational literature of HCI and applied (interaction) design.

Note:

- Philosophy

- I don't expect you to know how to read scientific papers from the start; this is one of our objectives. You will learn to summarize research papers in this way:
  - Research question
  - Hypotheses
  - Variables
  - Research Design
  - Data collection/protocol
  - Analysis
  - Results/findings
- Other considerations in critiques:
  - Does the paper seem important or not? Does it make a contribution?
  - Is the methodology sound or suspect?
  - Does this paper get its message across clearly?
  - Does it change your thoughts or has it introduced new ideas to you?

- My informal objectives:
  - Give you the tools to argue for design decisions based on cognitive needs
  - Give you confidence that your decisions are sound
  - Perform well in interviews when asked about formal training
  - Get you started with professional collaboration tools like GitHub

- I hope that by the end of this class you feel comfortable with the following:
  - Reading scientific papers
  - Presenting a user-centered design concept
  - Attending / Participating in an HCI conference
  - Designing a simple experiment; perhaps, for your thesis

- Texts
  - Ware - the relation between seeing and cognition. Basic principles that are fundamental to cognition, in general.
  - Kahneman - Nobel prize winner in heuristics and biases in human decision making. Founded a revolution in 'behavioral economics', despite not being an economist, but a cognitive psychologist.
    - Prospect theory - people analyze choices in terms of losses and gains instead of final outcome.
    - Heuristics and Biases - people use mental shortcuts in decision-making, often focusing on one aspect of a problem over others.
  - Johnson - decomposes well-known design guidelines to psychological bases. Covers most of the topics in the class, though we will build on knowledge in this class, not starting from design principles, but from the other direction - from how the brain works.

- Persuasion
  - I'll give you a brief preview of persuasion and why we end with a capstone case study.
  - Persuasion concerns influencing user behavior; it builds on all of the knowledge you gain in this course from perceptual patterns (or frames) to
  decision-making in context.

##  What's the Difference?

- Coercion
- Manipulation
- Persuasion

Note:

Force / no force
Witting / not witting

# Persuasion

Persuasive? Manipulative? Why?

- <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlT8VcWz3LY">Febreze</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBbzNp25OHo">Jiffy</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="http://nudges.org/2010/06/09/nudging-in-new-york-lunchroom-cafeterias/">Nudging in NY lunchroom cafeterias</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="http://nudges.org/2011/09/21/a-devious-little-marketing-nudge/">Marketing nudge</a>

Note:

- "Influence"
- Belief, Attitude, Intention, Behavior
- Often studied in the context of politics and advertising

- Jif
  - Choosy moms choose jif.
  - Implication: If you don't choose Jif, you are not a good mother.
- Febreze (odor remover)
  - Implication: Febreze works instead of washing

  P&G story.
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?_r=0</a>
  Febreze ads were doing poorly by telling people that Febreze would eliminate troublesome odors (e.g., pet smells, smoke on clothes). Wasn't working. P&G scientists studied this problem. Tied it to the routine of housecleaning -- specifically, a routine to finish tidying by spraying Febreze. Added a distinct smell.

Thaler's blog highlights mechanism for "choice architecture" as:
- The tools highlighted are:
  - defaults
  - expecting error
  - understanding mappings
  - giving feedback
  - structuring complex choices
  - creating incentives
