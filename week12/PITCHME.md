# Social networks

.pull-left[

**A social network consists of all the connections and ties within a group or collection of groups**

1. We shape our network
2. Our network shapes us
3. Our friends affect us
4. Our friends' friends' friends affect us
5. The network has a life of its own

Networks have:
- nodes
- connections
- flow (contagion)

Rule 1: Homophily. Tendency to associate with people that resemble us. But we decide how many people we connect go and the structure of our network.
Rule 2: You are connected - how dense is your network? The number of contacts friends and family have are relevant.
Rule 3: Every direct tie is the potential for strong influence. Are you more central or not? Does your network have high transitivity or not? Centrality and transitivity affects much.
Rule 4: Hyperdyadic spread is the tendency to spread beyond a direct social tie. Re-inforcement from multiple people plays a role in behavioral choices.
Rule 5: Networks have properties and functions (and shapes) in and of themselves. "Waves", bird flocking, swarming...

Based on Framingham Heart Survey Social network @ 2200 people. Spread of obesity, relations w/in network and changes over 32 years.

"For one week in January 2012, data scientists skewed what almost 700,000 Facebook users saw when they logged into its service. Some people were shown content with a preponderance of happy and positive words; some were shown content analyzed as sadder than average. And when the week was over, these manipulated users were more likely to post either especially positive or negative words themselves."

# Teens: Homophily and conformity effect

.center[![:scale 100%](images/conformity.jpg)]

???

Neural effects - Teens highly influenced by the number of "likes" on their own photos.

http://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/social-media-likes-impact-teens-brains-and-behavior.html


32 teens 13-18. 148 photos on screen for 12 mins including 40 of own photos.

fMRI brain activity studied. Large # of likes led to wide activity in the brain to include reward circuits, social cognition, imitation, and visual attentional centers.

More likely to like a photo when significant "liked".

"But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories."

“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”

“If Hillary had won, it would be better for us,” he said. “I could write about the bad things she was going to do,” he said. “I did not write to make Trump win. I just wanted to get viewers and make some money.”

# A puzzle

.center[![:scale 100%](images/milano.png)]

[Do tweets change your behavior?](http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/11/16/fowler.christakis.tweeting/)

???

Milano - 2011 timeframe 1M followers - posted on Twitter a direct link to Connected on Amazon.

What happened to sales? (no extra copies in a 24-hour period)

Maybe someone influential? Tim O'Reilly also sent out a tweet to about 1.5M followers. Small bounce.

Samantha Fox (4,345 followers) - another small bump.

More than the number of ties - nature and quality of ties.

Who are influential - who is influenceable? Personal connectedness in "real life"? (Strong ties) Timing? "Cost"?

# Voting behavior

61M person person experiment on FB (2010)

.center[![:scale 100%](images/Facebook_voting.jpg)]

???

Day of US congressional election. 98% saw a social message encouraging to vote at top of feed. Link to local polling place and clickable button "I voted". Counter and which friends through randomly selected profile pictures.

2% saw something different.

Half same box but without friends.
Half without message.

Messages mobilized people to express their desire to vote -- and social ones spurred some to vote. Rippling effects. (Offine correlational data used to measure.) Facts mattered when paired with social pressure.

Exploit weak ties on Twitter, FB, etc.

Very small commitment to get people to list themselves in a bone marrow registry.

# Cautionary tale

.pull-left[
Imagine you are on a JetBlue flight when a car ad of a cute green Kia Soul plays. Over free wi-fi, you then search for flights.

On FB, you start to see car ads. You are primed!

The advertiser already knows where you live, that you are renter, you have a dog, a steady job -- and travel frequently.

You start to research cars.

Disparity in the employment ads shown to men and women.

"As he explains, it’s not just these algorithms that are making decisions; it’s a combination of man, machine, and the interactions between them."

# Ad algorithms monitor your behavior

*Companies collect and broker information about your behavior*
- Clickstreams & cookies
- Search engine queries
- Online purchases
- Credit card data from offline purchases
- Profile data from social media platforms (views, relationships, etc.)
- URLs - url shorteners
- Location data based on your Internet access
- etc.

# Summary

- Close friends can have strong influence on behavior

- Three degrees of influence: If your social network was 20 x 20 x 20 - you would have an influence on 8000 people

- Weak messages can alter behavior by very small amounts ("Dragonfly effect"); but they may also play a role in in social contagion

- Data in aggregate may be used by algorithms to both predict and influence behavior

???

From the FB study - tiny effects 1/10 to 1/100th of a percentage point. Maybe no different than recent news and political advertisements (Gelman).

However, Fowler calculates friends generating 886K button clicks, close friends 559K, and close friends of close friends +1M -- in one message.

Networks have a multiplicative effect - Indirect effects of social contagion large. (Fowler)
