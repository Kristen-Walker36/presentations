# How do social networks affect behavior?
28 Nov 2017

## Review (1): Influences on decision-making

1. Brain architecture - perception, attention, memory,  emotion, experience, thinking
2. Communication
	- Dyads (F2F, SMS, Text, Chatbots...)
	- Social groups
3. Culture
4. Persuasion

Note:

Up until now, we’ve been talking about behavior from the perspective of biases in our human architecture, with a focus on brain and vision. We also looked at effects stemming from memory, personal experience, and associated feelings. Since humans are a social animal, we spent a lot of time talking about how we cooperate in communication both in conversation and in groups.

And because we are literally swimming in information, how we conventionalize information in both language and culture - almost invisibly. By conventionalizing language and behavior, we don't have to think about how to behave in different circumstances - we know by convention. We focused heavily on behavior in the context of decision-making since user interaction is fundamentally involves choice. Thus, we focused on the idea of ‘behavior as a medium’ for interaction designers.

Insights from Tversky and Kahneman revealed how much we rely on our intuitive System 1 for understanding and decision-making revealed that people are essentially lazy thinkers and not particularly rational, even when decisions are hard and complex. We replace difficult decisions with simple one such as picking political candidates by how they look and how we feel about them. And while most people care about privacy and the security of their computers, they still fail to install and use anti-virus software or cookie blockers.

All along, we’ve tied these ideas to persuasion both in how we craft language and user interactive experiences. The key until now has been how you design interfaces conversationally, tapping into user values and perceptions of cost (is it easy to install and run that anti-virus software?), in order nudge them toward a very natural response toward your intended message.

# Review (2)

<img src="images/persuasion-graphic.png" align="center" height="60%" width="60%">

Note:

Then we looked at techniques that compliance professionals use. Cialdini and others reference a number of techniques to include:

- **Consistency and Commitment** - if you can get someone to say something, or make a small commitment, they will gravitate toward this same idea later because people naturally prefer, and are more comfortable, with consistency.  Of course, there is a biological link to ‘consistency’ and an intrinsic survival mechanism to prefer familiar things.
- **Social Proof** - Like wise, we understood social proof, or our inclination to do as others do, from underlying neural mechanisms to draw our cues and mirror others. Social norms are also embedded in culture and are a powerful force: it is normal for people to report feeling "uncomfortable" when they don't follow norms.
- **Reciprocity** - A cornerstone for for our social instinct is to make exchanges. To give something, no matter how small, is to drive a corresponding need to give in return. Hence small tokens or free gifts drive up charitable contributions. On top of this, we receive small bursts of pleasure (i.e., dopaminergic) when someone interacts positively with us over social media using “likes”.
- **Liking** - We’re also strongly affected by our feelings. If we like someone, we tend to attend better and forgive small  inconsistencies.
- **Authority** - And, of course, appeals to authority have powerful sway over our thoughts and beliefs. Fancy, (high-falootin') words can have similar appeal. As in the old Listerine commercial ads, particularly, when paired with “and you know”...

There had even been a business developed by a student of BJ Fogg at Stanford U (Kapstein) centered on “persuasion profiling”, ostensibly to profile individual customers based on their responses to different influence strategies and dynamically adapts website contents to suit that customer.

As Cialdini and other compliance professional note, you can’t apply any of these techniques if you don’t have attention. Hence, businesses online are battling for your attention. This fuels the desire for companies to purchase products we use (such as FB’s 22 Billion dollar purchase of WhatsApp). The more time we interact with content, the easier it is to profile and target consumers.

https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21716460-forget-long-tail-battle-consumers-attention

Today we’re switching gears. Instead of talking about individuals and group, Christakis and Fowler talk about networks. Unlike groups (defined by an attribute; for example, demographic groups may be categorized by factors such as age, education, gender, and location), networks are characterized by connections or ties between people.

Christakis and Fowler talk about how the pattern of connections affect how information is spread. They give examples of various network shapes — or topology such as a bucket brigade, telephone tree, Ponzi scheme, or military squads, as structures that facilitate information flow in different ways.

And while we've been talking about user experience from the viewpoint of interaction as a dialogue between a user and interactive content designed by you -- we're going to shift slightly from thinking about persuasion to influence.

C&/F note that social networks are not great conduits for behavior change -- but they can exert influence on our attitudes and feelings.

### We know that information in social networks spreads contagiously, but can social networks influence?

Note: We'll have a discussion about this in a few minutes.

## Objectives

- Understand the potential for social networks to shape thought, emotion, and behavior
- Learn about challenges associated with determining influence in a social network
- Understand the purpose and utility of methods and tools used to measure human behavior within a social economy

Note:

We’re going to spend some time on the first question, because its not an open and shut case. We’ve only recently developed the means to study social networks at scale with the availability of social data at very large scale. And this is not laboratory controlled data that lets us easily examine causal questions.

The mechanisms by which social networks operate are complex. But there is a grand race to understand such networks; again, it’s a race for attention and influence. As Kevin Spacey said in an address in 2014, “anyone with an internet connection and an idea can develop an audience.” http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2014/09/kevin_spacey_challenges_conten.html.

There are a couple of dark sides to this story, of course. There is the very salient fact that all of us are subject to manipulation over social media. For a fascinating read, you can read about how a Russian troll @TEN_GOP gained influence in America’s political drama in 2016. It remained active for 18 months fooling both the left and the right.

“Its success came from its stepwise approach. First, it imitated genuine far-right commentators by posting hyper-partisan tweets, and attracted their attention by mentioning and praising them. Their responses gave it an appearance of legitimacy which allowed it to interact with higher-profile figures, including in the campaign, and to be quoted by genuine media outlets.” (2 017, Nimmo, B., How a Russian Troll Fooled America, https://medium.com/dfrlab/how-a-russian-troll-fooled-america-80452a4806d1)

While measuring influence in social networks is challenging, it is an emergent business area as evidenced by the influential klout measure. Finally, while we can be manipulated and driven as a herd, we are also more open to fine-grained targeting than ever before. We’ll look at a few ways marketing and advertising professionals are gather tiny social signals from users to quantify behavior.

## Social networks

**A social network consists of all the connections and ties within a group or collection of groups**

1. We shape our network
2. Our network shapes us
3. Our friends affect us
4. Our friends' friends' friends affect us
5. The network has a life of its own

Note:

Networks have:
- nodes
- connections
- flow (contagion)

Rule 1: Homophily. Tendency to associate with people that resemble us. But we decide how many people we connect go and the structure of our network.

Rule 2: You are connected - how dense is your network? The number of contacts friends and family have are relevant. This affects how information flows.

Rule 3: Every direct tie is the potential for strong influence. Are you more central or not? Does your network have high transitivity or not? Centrality and transitivity affects much. In an epidemiological model, if a virus is spreading through a network, where do you want to be?

Rule 4: Hyperdyadic spread is the tendency to spread beyond a direct social tie. Reinforcement from multiple people plays a role in behavioral choices.

This is a potential key insight Christakis’ and Fowler’ work. That those who are not closely connected still have an affect on our behavior. Think about social proof and how we take our cues from the norms of the group. And think back to the idea of mirror neurons where we naturally mirror what we observe. This affects both learning and social behavior. And is strongly tied to our intrinsic cooperative nature.

Perhaps, think of this as resonant frequencies or waves, as well. The reason this is a relatively new idea is because we finally have enough data to study such effects.

Rule 5: Networks have properties and functions (and shapes) in and of themselves. "Waves", bird flocking, swarming... this behavior seems to be some sort of collective intelligence that is a property of groups and not individuals.

# Three degrees of influence

<img src="images/paper-dolls.png" align="center" height="80%" width="80%">

Note:

The core insight promulgated by C\&F is “The Three Degrees Rule” which they ascribe to behaviors, attitudes, and feelings. Your friends-friends-friends may influence you. These seem to be fairly stable network ties. Beyond this there is much noice - which C\&F talk about in terms of “intrinsic decay”.


# Discussion

### We know that information in social networks spreads contagiously, but can social networks influence?

Note:

- Difficult to study social influence effects in observational studies. How do we know whether social networks operate in the same way as face-to-face social networks?

- How do we know the network influences and other factors such as Homophily are not the cause?

- Framework to distinguish influence and homophily effects in dynamic networks.
	- "Global instant messaging network of 27.4 million users, using data on the day-by-day adoption of a mobile service application and users' longitudinal behavioral, demographic, and geographic data."
	- "We find that previous methods overestimate peer influence in product adoption decisions in this network by 300–700%, and that homophily explains >50% of the perceived behavioral contagion."

## Contagion

Note:

Based on Framingham Heart Survey Social network @ 2200 people. Spread of obesity, relations w/in network and changes over 32 years.

Other relevant evidence for emotional contagion:

"For one week in January 2012, data scientists skewed what almost 700,000 Facebook users saw when they logged into its service. Some people were shown content with a preponderance of happy and positive words; some were shown content analyzed as sadder than average. And when the week was over, these manipulated users were more likely to post either especially positive or negative words themselves."

## Teens: Homophily and conformity effect

<img src="images/conformity.jpg" align="center" height="80%" width="80%">

http://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/social-media-likes-impact-teens-brains-and-behavior.html

Note:

Neural effects - Teens highly influenced by the number of "likes" on their own photos.

32 teens 13-18. 148 photos on screen for 12 mins including 40 of own photos.

fMRI brain activity studied. Large # of likes led to wide activity in the brain to include reward circuits, social cognition, imitation, and visual attentional centers.

More likely to like a photo when significant "liked".

## What social phenomena can we see in networks?


<img src="images/talk-actions-network.png" align="center" height="100%" width="100%">

Note:

When we're studying social networks, we look for observable, quantifiable signals. If you think back to the reading we did on Clark and how dialogue works as joint action, he alluded to the idea that talk was a kind of action just like any other cooperative activity.

 Language is intrinsically social and social structures -- like social networks -- are intrinsically linguistic. So while its great that mathematicians and physicists give us great insight into how to model dynamic networks, to actually make sense of information contained in networks requires social science. So what we know from Clark is that, not only is the content important, but the process by which people communicate. We care about how information is signaled via actions and we also care about how people are connected to each other.

 When studying social networks, these are the sort of signals that answer questions like:
 - What communities of people care about chess?
 - If they like baseball, what other things do they like?
 - What sites do they visit?
 - etc.

---
## Where can we observe influence in a network?

- Message content
- Actions and behavior of strong ties
- Weak ties

Note:

- What really matters is the nature and quality of the tie.
-
Weak ties (according to C\&F):
- 46% of the variation in how many friends you have is explained by your genes. (Okay, so not too surprising that this would be a facet of personality.)
- But 47% in the variation in whether your friends know each other is attributable to your genes. So, perhaps, some people are likely to introduce their friends to one another, and some are not. This has an impact on the structure of your network.
- 30% of the variation in whether people are in the middle or edge of a network is attributable to their genes.

# Networks are like a super-organism

Note:

— You can’t study the individuals to see properties of the whole - these properties are not reducible.

## Social media news use


<img src="images/news-from-facebook.png" align="center" width="100%" height="100%">

http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/

Note:

A majority of Americans get their news via social media and most only get their news on one site. The demographics are different across sites and all of this is changing over time.

From: Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory - this is all about income

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/world/europe/fake-news-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-georgia.html


"... Among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories."

“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”

“If Hillary had won, it would be better for us,” he said. “I could write about the bad things she was going to do,” he said. “I did not write to make Trump win. I just wanted to get viewers and make some money.”

## A puzzle

<img src="images/milano.png" align="center" width="100%" height="100%">

[Do tweets change your behavior?](http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/11/16/fowler.christakis.tweeting/)

Note:

"Although our research shows that obesity, happiness and even divorce can spread in networks between close friends, there is little evidence that behaviors spread between the tenuous relationships people have online."

Milano - 2011 timeframe 1M followers - posted on Twitter a direct link to Connected on Amazon.

What happened to sales? (no extra copies in a 24-hour period)

Maybe someone influential? Tim O'Reilly also sent out a tweet to about 1.5M followers. Small bounce.

Samantha Fox (4,345 followers) - another small bump, but bigger than the other two.

More than the number of ties - nature and quality of ties.

Who are influential - who is influenceable? Personal connectedness in "real life"? (Strong ties) Timing? "Cost"?

## Voting behavior

61M person person experiment on FB (2010)

<img src="images/Facebook_voting.jpg" align="center" height="80%" width="80%">

http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2012/09/12/a-61-million-person-experiment-on-facebook-shows-how-ads-and-friends-affect-our-voting-behaviour/

Note:

	- F2F social pressure and strong ties very effective
	- But most information campaigns little influence
	- Randomized trial on FB

	Bond, R. M., Fariss, C. J., Jones, J. J., Kramer, A. D., Marlow, C., Settle, J. E., & Fowler, J. H. (2012). A 61-million-person experiment in social influence and political mobilization. Nature, 489(7415), 295-298.

Day of US congressional election. 98% saw a social message encouraging to vote at top of feed. Link to local polling place and clickable button "I voted". Counter and which friends through randomly selected profile pictures.

2% saw something different.
Half same box but without friends.
Half without message.

Messages mobilized people to express their desire to vote -- and social ones spurred some to vote. Rippling effects. (Offline correlational data used to measure.)

## Media Influence Campaigns

<img src="images/influencer-discovery-tools.png" align="center" height="80%" width="80%">

Note:

There is a race to understand how to find and shape influencers in addition to direct targeting of consumers or individuals.

It’s not easy to find influencers: you can’t just use centrality and assume it’s a valid measure... in fact, it isn’t. But it does indicate a potential influential position in terms of information flow.

Variables:
- local vs global context
- authentic, credible voice
- likability
- social and network context
- emotion in social environment
- medium
- ??

## Cautionary tale

<img src="images/green-kia.jpg" align="center" height="80%" width="80%">

http://cmtoday.cmu.edu/technology_business/online-advertising-marketing-research/

Note:

Imagine you are on a JetBlue flight when a car ad of a cute green Kia Soul plays over free wi-fi. You then search for flights.

On Facebook, you start to see car ads. You are primed!

The advertiser already knows where you live, that you are renter, you have a dog, a steady job -- and travel frequently.

You start to research cars.

Some problems with this:
- disparity in what is shown to different ad segments (e.g., gender, zipcode)
- privacy concerns
- inferences made by combining data

"As he explains, it’s not just these algorithms that are making decisions; it’s a combination of man, machine, and the interactions between them."

---

## Algorithms monitor behavior

- Clickstreams & cookies
- Search engine queries
- Online purchases
- Credit card data from offline purchases
- Profile data from social media platforms (views, relationships, etc.)
- URLs - url shorteners
- Location data based on your Internet access
- etc.

## Klout - Who are the influencers (we can influence)?

<img src="images/klout-big.jpg" align="center" height="50%" width="50%">

Note:

  The Klout metric is an influence scoring system that assigns scores to social media across social networks
on a daily basis. While Klout scores are derived using machine learning across hundreds of features, it also includes
more specific measures, which Klout calls:
- **true reach** - based on the audience size for a particular user; those who actively engage with user messages;
- **amplification** - liklihood that messages will generate actions such as retweets, mentions, likes, comments;
- **network impact** -  computed influence value of a person's engaged audience (I’m unsure of what the variables are here)

About 400 signals per person across multiple social media platforms such as Twitter, FB, LinkedIn, etc.

https://www.wired.com/2012/04/ff_klout/
Extract:
“But even if you have no idea what your Klout score is, there’s a chance that it’s already affecting your life. At the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas last summer, clerks surreptitiously looked up guests’ Klout scores as they checked in. Some high scorers received instant room upgrades, sometimes without even being told why. According to Greg Cannon, the Palms’ former director of ecommerce, the initiative stirred up tremendous online buzz. He says that before its Klout experiment, the Palms had only the 17th-largest social-networking following among Las Vegas-based hotel-casinos. Afterward, it jumped up to third on Facebook and has one of the highest Klout scores among its peers.”

https://www.wired.com/2015/05/new-browser-extension-decides-trustworthy/

Extract:
“A new company is trying to do an end-run around that intransigence by scraping publicly available information from various sharing-economy services and compiling it into a trust score between 0 and 100. Called Karma, it works as a browser extension—any time you pull up a supported site (which currently includes Airbnb, Craigslist, Dogvacay, Ebay, Etsy, RelayRides, and Vayable) a pop-up window will ask if you want to link your account to your Karma score. That score is calculated by looking at the reviews you've received—both the quantitative ratings (the number of stars, for instance) as well as a textual analysis of written comments.”

## Summary

- Close friends can have strong influence on behavior
- Three degrees of influence: If your social network were 20 x 20 x 20 - you would have an influence on 8000 people
- Weak messages can alter behavior by very small amounts ("butterfly effect")
- Data in aggregate may be used by algorithms to both predict and influence behavior

Note:

From the FB study - tiny effects 1/10 to 1/100th of a percentage point. Maybe no different than recent news and political advertisements (Gelman).

"The differences may seem small, but try scaling them up. If the proportion of voters rises by 0.39 percentage points and you’re dealing with 61 million people, you’ve got 238,000 extra votes.""

Networks have a multiplicative effect - Indirect effects of social contagion large. (Fowler)
